*Create 'Book a ride' application (like Uber).

- User has given car types like Mini,Go,Auto and Moto (Make these classes anonymous).
- Make an abstract class 'Booking' which includes methods 'findRide' and 'estimateFare' (mark them abstract).
- All car type classes should override all these methods.
- 'estimateFare' calculates fare based on car type.like,
	fare=(endRideLocation-startRideLocation)*cost per km.
-'cost per km' is different for all car type.
-All ride classes must have some cars in list for finding a ride.

*Sample:

Choose your Ride:
	1.Mini
	2.Go
	3.Auto
	4.Moto
